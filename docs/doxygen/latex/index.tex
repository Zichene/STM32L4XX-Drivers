Bare-\/metal implementation of some drivers for the STM32\+L4 family of devices. See example projects showcasing these drivers at \href{https://github.com/Zichene/STM32L4XX-Drivers/tree/main/projects-bl4s5i-iot01a}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Zichene/\+STM32\+L4\+XX-\/\+Drivers/tree/main/projects-\/bl4s5i-\/iot01a}}. These drivers were mostly tested using the B-\/\+L4\+S5\+I-\/\+IOT01A development board from ST.

WARNING\+: These drivers were written for educational purposes. These have not been tested thoroughly, use at own risk. These drivers should only use on STM32\+L4\+XX devices.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{index_install_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clone the repo or download desired files.
\item In your embedded project environment, simply add the desired {\ttfamily .h} and {\ttfamily .c} files. Make sure that you set up the include paths correctly!
